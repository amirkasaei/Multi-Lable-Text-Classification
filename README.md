# Multi-Lable-Text-Classification
Recurrent Neural Network(LSTM, GRU, etc) Multi Label Classification on Persian Sentences

# Description
**Project name: Recurrent Neural Network using Keras (Multi Label Classification on Persian Sentences)**

The primary dataset has many samples of 2 persian sentences and their similarity score.   

This project has included:
  1. Extracting subjects of each sentence using [Hazm](https://github.com/sobhe/hazm) library
  2. Subject Classification Neural Network to predict subject class of each sentence
  3. Preprocessing on dataset like compose score class and subject class for each sample
  4. Multi Label Classification RNN to predict score and subject class
    
Neural Networks models implemented by Keras in Tensorflow library.
